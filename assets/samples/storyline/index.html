  <h1>Interactive Compliance Training – Storyline Sample</h1>
  <p>
    This demo module showcases my approach to building scenario-based eLearning in
    Articulate Storyline. Learners move through realistic situations, make decisions,
    and receive targeted feedback intended to drive real behavior change, not just
    quiz scores.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Branching scenarios with multiple decision paths</li>
    <li>Layered feedback explaining correct and incorrect choices</li>
    <li>Embedded knowledge checks and a scored final assessment</li>
    <li>HTML5 export suitable for LMS deployment</li>
  </ul>
