  <h1>Technical Program Management Case Study: ASIC Architecture & Verification Alignment</h1>
  <p>
    A silicon TPM case study simulating how a program manager drives predictability, risk reduction,
    and cross-functional alignment across top-level architecture, IP integration, and verification readiness.
  </p>
</section>

<main class="container main">

  <!-- Project Overview + Architecture Workflow -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This scenario mirrors a GPU / SoC-style program in an AMD / NVIDIA / Intel environment. The focus is on
      keeping architecture intent, IP integration, and verification aligned so G3 readiness is predictable rather
      than reactive. The diagram below shows the end-to-end architecture workflow you would inherit as a silicon TPM.
    </p>

    <figure class="img-figure">
      <img src="/assets/img/architecture_workflow_blue_steel.svg"
           alt="Architecture workflow showing top-level architecture flowing into IP specs, integration planning, block-level interfaces, firmware and hardware co-design, and validation readiness." />
      <figcaption>
        Architecture Workflow — from top-level architecture through IP specs, integration planning, block-level
        interfaces, FW/HW co-design, and ultimately validation readiness.

  </section>

  <!-- Section 1: Architecture Definition & Spec Traceability -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>1. Top-Level Architecture & IP Spec Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      Early in the program, architecture and requirements change quickly. As TPM, I put structure around the churn:
      we lock an architecture review cadence, track decision history, and maintain a living spec traceability view.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Biweekly architecture governance review with clear owners and decision logs.</li>
      <li>Traceability between performance requirements, IP ownership, and verification targets.</li>
      <li>Visibility for leadership into which requirements are covered vs. still at risk.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Section 2: IP Integration Planning & Dependency Dashboard -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>2. IP Integration Planning & Dependency Management</h2>
    <p>
      The biggest failure mode in silicon programs is unmanaged dependencies. Here, I use a dependency dashboard to
      track readiness scores for key IPs — GPU, Memory, IO, Security — and visualize how they converge into SoC top.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Readiness scoring for each IP (R-score) feeding into G2/G3 gate prep.</li>
      <li>Clear upstream / downstream relationships into the SoC top integration hub.</li>
      <li>Early visibility of which IPs are gating system-level validation.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Section 3: Verification Readiness & G3 Gate Preparation -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>3. Verification Readiness & G3 Gate Preparation</h2>
    <p>
      Verification is the highest schedule and quality risk. I treat the verification dashboard as a program heartbeat:
      it aggregates functional and code coverage, ties them to IPs, and compares them to the G3 target line.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functional + code coverage by IP, with a clear G3 threshold line.</li>
      <li>Used weekly to drive triage and focus on coverage gaps before gate review.</li>
      <li>Feeds directly into risk register entries for late coverage or missing tests.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Section 4: Risk Register & Mitigation Strategy -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>4. Risk Register & Mitigation Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      All of the dashboards above roll into a structured risk register focused on architectural churn, late IP delivery,
      verification gaps, and timing closure issues. This register is what leadership actually consumes week to week.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Risks tagged by owner, impact, likelihood, and affected G-milestones.</li>
      <li>Direct trace from risk entries to coverage, IP readiness, or spec gaps.</li>
      <li>Mitigation plans with dates that can be tracked like any other deliverable.</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>5. Final Outcomes & Case Study PDF</h2>
    <p>
      In this simulated program, applying this TPM approach to architecture, integration, and verification produced
      three main outcomes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predictable G3 gate with clear evidence and fewer last-minute “heroics”.</li>
      <li>Reduced late-stage blockers through governance around architecture changes and IP readiness.</li>
      <li>Reusable dashboards and templates that can be pulled into future silicon programs or reused across lines of business.</li>
    </ul>
